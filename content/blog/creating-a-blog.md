# Learning Machine

{{< youtube id="FN2B2NIYkjQ" >}}



# Why This
I started looking into Jeykll to document my journey dealing with technologies while I am learning those. I also plan on creating a knowledgebase site !(https://goforaditya.github.io/know) as repo for taking short notes of everything I learn (maybe a custom gitchekout and store the MD files seperately for better vis.). 

But then I stumbled on Hugo and looking at how simple it is to step and the colourful themes (mostly themes) I settled for hugo. Now I will create a diary and note the things to do BYE!
