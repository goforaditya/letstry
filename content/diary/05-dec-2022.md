- Made HUGO site for personal blog.
- Posted project ideas on Trello board.

Need to do:
- Make knowledgebase using a documentation template !(https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/) Docsy is a good theme created by google but requires some npm stuff need to figure out.
- First know doc can be just a list of all the links needed to create the blog and all the issues faced
- Need to create a learning plan. Databricks, ML and React (full stack) seem most promising now.
- Need to get cretifications.
